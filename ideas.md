<h1>Stuff that could be added:</h1>
<br>

<!--Add an ordered list for each section in this format:

<h2>[Section title]</h2>
<ol>
    <li>[Item]</li>

    <ul>
        <li>[Some stuff about this item.]</li>
    </ul>

</ol>


-->

<h2>Auth screen</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Slicker "remember me" interface</li>

    - Maybe something to do with a little menu to confirm that you want to login.
    - Also, with current setup (15/03/25), when yes is clicked, the login screen is loaded, but this shouldn't happen, or a confirmation screen should be shown that the user is logging in.

    <li>[Item]</li>

    <ul>
        <li>[Some stuff about this item.]</li>
    </ul>

</ol>

<h2>Adding tasks</h2>
<ol>
    <li>List of sub tasks</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Could include a literal smaller lists of tasks with the identical structure,
            or could instead be a set of simple text tasks with no other parameters.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <li>[Item]</li>

    <ul>
        <li>[Some stuff about this item.]</li>
    </ul>

</ol>
