<h1>Stuff that could be added to Tickd.</h1>

<!--View on GitHub: -->

<!--Add an ordered list for each section in this format:

<h2>[Section title]</h2>

<ol>
<h3><li>[Item]</li></h3>
- Something about this item.
-- Get a bit more specific
- Another thing about this item.
</ol>


-->

<h2>Auth screen</h2>
<ol>
    
<h3><li>Slicker "remember me" interface</li></h3>
    
- Maybe something to do with a little menu to confirm that you want to login.
- Also, with current setup (15/03/25), when yes is clicked, the login screen is loaded, but this shouldn't happen, or a confirmation screen should be shown that the user is logging in.

</ol>

<h2>Adding tasks</h2>
<ol>
    
<h3><li>List of sub tasks</li></h3>
- Could include a literal smaller lists of tasks with the identical structure, or could instead be a set of simple text tasks with no other parameters.


<h3><li>[Item]</li></h3>


</ol>
