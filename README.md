<h1>Tickd: task management made easy</h1>

<p>This is the repository for all the stuff to do with my A2 Project, Tickd.</p>
<br>

<h2>The <b>lib</b> folder</h2>
<p>Contains all the smaller processes, such as getWallpaper() [getting a random wallpaper], getDetails() [for all json handling], and my own created widgets, such as <a href="lib//checkbox_customTk.py">checkbox</a> and <a href="lib//submitBtn.py">submitBtn</a></p>
